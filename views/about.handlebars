        <h3>Description of Apps</h3>
        <p>Team Turkey presents Glean, a change to charity program that will help you feel
            that little goodness, those warm fuzzies for putting your money to good use.
        </p>
        <p>You make a purchase, Glean rounds up the cost, subtracts the actual purchase from the cost,
            and that difference goes to a charity of your choice!
        </p>
        <p>Glean does this by integrating into your bank account and keeping track of the charges you make.
            Itâ€™s easy, safe, and secure.

        <h3>How Glean works</h3>
        <p>Every time you makes a purchase,
            the difference in change to the nearest dollar is donated to a charity of choice.
        </p>
        <p>Glean takes away the hassles of dealing with change when balancing checkbooks,
            and helps anyone with credit or debit cards easily give to charities in need.
        </p>
        <p>These microdonations add up overtime,
            and Glean will elegantly present donations accumulated to better help you see the impact you are making.
