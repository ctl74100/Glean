# Team TurkeyApp

## Overview
Team Turkey presents Glean, a change to charity program that will help you feel that little goodness, those warm fuzzies for putting your money to good use.

You make a purchase, Glean rounds up the cost, subtracts the actual purchase from the cost, and that difference goes to a charity of your choice!

Glean does this by integrating into your bank account and keeping track of the charges you make. Itâ€™s easy, safe, and secure.

## How To Run

Aquire the credentials.js file for database authentication from an admin. Place this file in the main directory.

Run the following commands in bash:

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

## Session States

There are three states: logged in as users, logged in as admin and not-logged in.

When the user is non-logged in, they may only access the following views:

  `home`
  `team`
  `login`
  `register`
  `forgetPassword`
  `about`

When the user is logged in as a user, they may only access the following views:

  `userhome`
  `dashboard`
  `profile`
  `team`
  `login`
  `register`
  `forgetPassword`
  `about`

When the user is logged in as an admin, they may only access the following views:

  `admin`
  `adminhome`
  `home`
  `team`
  `login`
  `register`
  `forgetPassword`
  `about`

There are two JavaScript files for routing. One is `user-routes.js` and the other is `admin-routes.js`. They are in the directory called `routes`. `user-routes.js` handles the routes to the views only for users. `admin-routes.js` handles the routes to the views only for admin. There are also some route handling in `app.js` for general routes accessible to non-users.


[user-routes.js](routes/user-routes.js) ,
[admin-routes.js](routes/admin-routes.js) ,
[app.js](app.js)



## Persistence

![database diagram](/gleanDB.png)

The diagram above is the schema of collections in the database. The documents are created within the `/lib/database.js` file and are wrapped up with functions for adding, finding, removing and updating these documents. `mongoose` is utilized to better facilitate modeling.

The documents are listed below:

`User` : user information / credentials for login

`Credit` : credit card information to be used when making purchases

`Transaction` : transaction made by a user

`Charity` : charity identifier

[database.js](lib/database.js)
