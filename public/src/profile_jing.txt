I am JingFeng Liu, and I am currently a senior at UMass Amherst with majoring in Computer Science. For this Glean project, I worked as a back-end. So far I have designed the Mockup/wireframe views for the web application. The reason for me to take this course is primarily the major requirement, but also I want to learn how to do the web programming. So, this will help me how to build a web application in the future.
