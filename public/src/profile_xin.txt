This is Xin. My last name is Liu. I am a senior computer sciences student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. In the Glean project, I play as a Back-end role. I would work as an assistant to help other members to build the Glean apps.
I started to get in touch with web application my summer job. From the job, I got a professional and functional view of a website. I think that the web programming language should be one of the important skill in my future profession. Therefore,  I registered for this course.
I learn CS in my high school junior year. It is one of the special elective in my high school. I followed my other classmates to pick this course in my course list. It was difficult to understand the coding language at first. Studying with a large group of classmates outside of school help me a lot to learn the code step-by-step. After that, I found that it was very interesting to apply my logic thinking to the computer code, and then a application came out as a visible product of my thought. Because of these, I choose the CS as my Bachelors Degrees Major.
