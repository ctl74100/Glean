I'm Eric Gendreau, and I'm a Junior Computer Science Major at UMass Amherst concentrating in Software Engineering. As a part of our small group of software engineers at Glean, I am a full stack member of the team. I enjoy delving into the entire process of creating software, from strategizing how to best architect the backend, to helping create the finishing touches on the site's design. I'm very excited to make our app great, and look forward to the adventure that awaits.
