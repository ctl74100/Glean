Hello! My name is Ren. I'm a senior at Smith College studying Computer Science. You must be wondering why I'm taking a class at UMass. Simply, my college doesn't provide a practical programming-intensive course in web programming - which is the type of engineering I'm interested in - and I've heard a lot of praise regarding Professor Tim Richards.  I'm particularly interested in the back-end as someone who loves to handle data. This is how I ended up as the back-end engineer for Glean. I'm also sometimes the manager for the team.
I love the applications of CS - theory isn't my jab although my favorite course is Algorithms - as someone who considers herself a craftswoman. I like building things and working with my hands. I used to play LEGOs all the times as a child; I took woodworking in high school; I've had experience in constructing fences; I've made stuffed animals out of felt and thread. I also love how CS can be applied to so many fields. There's healthcare, biology, retail, genealogy, robotics, and, the one I'm most excited about, government!
